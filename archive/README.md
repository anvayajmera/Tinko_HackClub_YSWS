# Archive - Original Single File Version

This folder contains the original single-file implementation of the YSWS Hack Club website.

## File Description

- `original-single-file.html` - The complete website in a single HTML file (1,627 lines)
  - Contains HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript functionality
  - Features all animations, glassmorphism effects, and responsive design
  - Served as the foundation for the React component conversion

## Why Archived?

This version has been archived in favor of the React-based architecture for the following reasons:

✅ **Better Maintainability** - React components vs 1,600+ line monolith
✅ **Team Collaboration** - Multiple developers can work on different components
✅ **Reusability** - Components can be reused and tested independently  
✅ **Modern Development** - Hot reload, debugging tools, and modern workflow
✅ **Scalability** - Easy to add new features and sections

## Historical Significance

This single file represents the original premium website design with:
- Scroll-triggered animations
- SVG line effects
- Glassmorphism design
- Particle systems
- Mobile responsiveness
- Counter animations

The React version maintains 100% of this functionality while providing a modern, maintainable architecture.
